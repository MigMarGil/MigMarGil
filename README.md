### Profile

I am a Computer Science student focused on **programming language design and compiler implementation**, with particular interest in **type systems, intermediate representations, and low-level code generation**.

My work emphasizes understanding systems **from first principles**, prioritizing correctness, explicit semantics, and well-defined abstractions.

---

### Current focus

- Design and implementation of **Vela**, a modern programming language
- Compiler pipelines: parsing, semantic analysis, IR design, and optimization
- **LLVM-based backends** and code generation
- Static type systems and language semantics

**Medium-term objective:** deliver a complete LLVM backend and a minimal, well-specified standard library for Vela.

---

### Selected project

#### Vela Programming Language

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=MigMarGil&repo=Vela_lang&theme=dark)](https://github.com/MigMarGil/Vela_lang)

Vela is an experimental programming language designed to explore language design trade-offs, strong static typing, and modern compilation techniques.  
The project serves both as a research-oriented exercise and a practical implementation of compiler theory.

### GitHub activity

My public repositories primarily reflect ongoing work on programming
languages and compiler-related projects, with an emphasis on correctness
and explicit design.


---

### Statement

I believe that building a programming language is one of the most rigorous ways to understand computation.  
Vela exists as a direct consequence of that belief.
